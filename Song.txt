Let me feel you
It's been about a month and 20 days
And we're goin' 'round and 'round, playin' silly games
Now you're sayin', "Slow it down, not right now"
Then you wink at me and walk away
But let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touchin' and teasin' me, tellin' me no
But this time I need to feel you
we're all alone
(Ride it) just lose control
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
Movida was the club on the Saturday
You're actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
Reapply ya lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favourite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckonin' for me to dance
Mmm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
(Then you close your eyes) and you close your eyes, girl
Whisperin', tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home? I wanna
Ride it, we're all alone
(Ride it) just lose control
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) ooh, baby, let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
Everything was right until her phone began to ring
She takes it to the corner, that's when I start wondering
I can hear her shouting, banging fists against the door
Yelling, "Yo, it's over, I can't take it anymore"
Then I walk away and act all nonchalant and chill
I ain't tryna get all caught up in her mess, for real
